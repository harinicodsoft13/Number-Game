## DESCRIPTION 


The Number Game is a simple guessing game where:

The computer selects a random number within a given range (for example 1 to 100).

The user tries to guess the number.

After each guess, the program gives hints like:

“Too High” → if the guess is greater than the secret number

“Too Low” → if the guess is smaller

The user continues guessing until they find the correct number.

The program also counts the number of attempts made.

This game is often used to understand loops, conditional statements, and random number generation in programming.
## OUTCOME OF PROGRAM
When you run the program:

The system will ask the user to enter a guess.

Depending on the input, the program will either:

Guide the player with hints (high/low), OR

Congratulate them if the correct number is guessed.

It will finally show how many attempts were required
